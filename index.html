                Professors Jumadinova (Chair), Bonham-Carter, Kapfhammer, Luman

            <P>Computer Science focuses on computational theory and the rich interplay between computer hardware and
                software. Students use scientific and design-centric approaches to solve computational problems and to
                create and evaluate realistic computer and computer-based systems.

                The study of computer science leads to and requires the ability to analyze ideas, to think logically,
                and to communicate ideas clearly and concisely. In this way, study of computer science contributes to
                the foundation of an excellent liberal arts education.

                Computer Science Learning Outcomes
                Demonstrate and be able to communicate the knowledge of data types, algorithms, and mathematical
                principles behind discrete objects.
                Use scientific and theoretical methods to design, implement, evaluate, deploy, improve, maintain, and
                document software and hardware systems.
                Apply and articulate key concepts from a specialization area where the interconnection between software
                and hardware is important and evident.
                Able to communicate technical details of the produced software and hardware artifacts both in writing
                and orally.

            <P>Carnegie Mellon 3-2 Program
                Allegheny College has a formal agreement with the Heinz College of Carnegie Mellon University to offer a
                3-2 cooperative program. Students who enroll in this accelerated master's degree program will complete
                three years of study at Allegheny College and two years at Carnegie Mellon University. Upon completion
                of this program, the student will receive both a bachelor's and master's degree in less time than is
                usually required to earn both of these degrees.

                The Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy is home to two internationally recognized
                graduate-level institutions at Carnegie Mellon University: the School of Information Systems and
                Management and the School of Public Policy and Management.

                Heinz College offers an accelerated master’s program to qualified Allegheny College students. The
                program, structured as three years at Allegheny College followed by three to four semesters at the Heinz
                College (depending upon program), allows students to earn both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in
                less time than is normally required.

                The following cooperative master’s programs are available:

                Master of Arts Management (MAM)
                Master of Entertainment Industry Management (MEIM)
                Master of Information Systems Management (MISM)
                Master of Science in Information Security Policy & Management (MSISPM)
                Master of Science in Health Care Policy and Management (MSHCPM)
                Master of Science in Public Policy and Management (MSPPM)
                Heinz College awards students and alumni of Allegheny College who enroll in any of the master’s programs
                at Heinz College a minimum scholarship of 30% of tuition per semester. This scholarship is available to
                Allegheny College alumni who enroll in the 3-2 program or pursue their master’s degree at Heinz College
                after four years of study at Allegheny College.

                Students pay tuition and fees to Allegheny College from their freshman through junior years. They pay
                tuition and fees to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) for their graduate program, either three or four
                semesters beyond the completion of the junior year, depending upon the master’s program. Allegheny
                students also will be responsible for paying a maintenance fee to Allegheny while enrolled at CMU in
                their senior year.

                Students will receive both the bachelor’s and master’s degrees upon completion of their graduate program
                at CMU. Allegheny College will count units taken during the master’s program toward the student’s
                bachelor’s degree according to its policies and procedures. CMU will forward to Allegheny College
                transcripts and other necessary information on student academic performance.

                Allegheny College students are eligible for scholarship support from Allegheny College for their
                freshman through junior years. They will be eligible for scholarship support from the Heinz College
                (including the 30% minimum scholarship mentioned above) for the length of their graduate program and can
                apply to any and all Heinz College scholarship funds for which they are eligible (based on program and
                the individual scholarship fund’s specific requirements).</P>
